Since the beginning of my profile career I have developed a profound admiration for Airbus and a sense of pride for what we do. I first joined Airbus working for Quality in 2020 where I had the opportunity to work side by side with an excellent team. 

Such an experience was critical not only to set the foundations of "right first time" mindset from Safety and Customer's perspective, but to create an international network of colleagues with which I still have the pleasure to work closely with.

 
Following Quality, I joined Operations with the OWE team where customer centricity, sharp attention to details, customer centricity, and appropriate stakeholder management in a very complex environment are part of the daily business, especially concerning Performance Management topics. Such a change was not only very challenging and enriching at once but it soon provided me with very valuable insights, experience and a steep professional growth difficult to experience otherwise.

%Throughout the last four years, I have been working at different Airbus divisions developing and leading innovative projects that have improved the aeronautical manufacturing processes and the business management. Some of the key successes are the achievement of the AOS Industrial Excellence in 2017 and 2018 in Puerto Real Plant or the Digital Quality BSC tool implemented in Broughton Plant. In order to accomplish them, my teams challenged the statu quo at all levels through digital transformation and stakeholder management (among other aspects). This has allowed me to acquire a solid experience in Data Analytics and Business Intelligence and a relevant experience in the field of operations as a Software Developer, Data Scientist and coach.
%
%Although this experience and studies are constantly providing me with an excellent professional background in the aerospace industry, I am continuously seeking to take a step forward in my career. For this reason, while working for Airbus, I have completed a Masters in Professional Development, a Masters in Big Data and Business Analytics and subsequently enrolled in a Masters in Astronautics and Space Engineering. These studies are allowing me not only to boost my skills in Data Science and Data Analysis but above all to take pleasure in understanding and using the power that data is offering nowadays.
%
%I truly believe that OWE is the perfect scenario to continue, improve and take that step forward in my professional career as I have already had the opportunity to participate in some of the activities in which teamwork, challenge, innovation, improvement, leadership, and \textit{Business Intelligence} were some of the key aspects. To me, stepping outside the comfort zone with challenging projects allowing new technical solutions is not only appropriate but the best way to achieve excellence and welcome the future in the so-called \textit{Era of Data}.
 
 
%PARAGRAPH THREE: Request a personal interview and indicate your flexibility as to the time and place. Repeat your phone number in the letter and offer assistance to help in a speedy response. For example, state that you will be in the city where the company is located on a certain date and would like to set up an interview. Alternatively, state that you will call on a certain date to set up an interview. End the letter by thanking the employer for taking time to consider your credentials. 

%I would be profoundly pleased and thankful to have the opportunity of joining your team to contribute Airbus to, as you mention, ``\textit{become the benchmark for the aerospace industry} [...] \textit{through continuous improvement driven by competitiveness, creativity and teamwork...}''. I encourage you to contact Gary Charnock if needed and I remain at your disposal for any additional clarification you may require. Thank you for taking the time to read my letter and considering my application.
