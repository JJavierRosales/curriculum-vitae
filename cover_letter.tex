Dear Jean Fran\c cois,

\vspace{10pt}

I am writing to express my interest in the \textit{Business Integration Manager} position that has been posted in MyPulse tool. I believe the skills that I have acquired throughout my time at Airbus will allow me to bring valuable contributions to your team.

%PARAGRAPH TWO: Indicate why you are interested in the position, the company, its products, services - above all, stress what you can do for the employer. If you are a recent graduate, explain how your academic background makes you a qualified candidate for the position. If you have practical work experience, point out specific achievements or unique qualifications. Try not to repeat the same information the reader will find in the resume. Refer the reader to the enclosed resume or application which summarizes your qualifications, training, and experiences. The purpose of this section is to strengthen your resume by providing details which bring your experiences to life.

I joined our Airbus family in 2020 to work in Quality at the Broughton Plant, one of the most important organisations within Airbus. The opportunity to work for a department in a Plant with such a solid heritage was enriching from the very beginning, mainly due to two reasons: a remarkable attention to detail and a consolidated status-quo that continuously challenged any change and transformation initiatives within the organisation. Working in Quality Performance Management while leading a brand-new digital transformation in the organisation helped me to develop not only the exhaustive attention to detail required for the job, but also the ability to design strategies for business transformation, and most importantly, the change management skills that are essential to support the transition towards a new organisation such as the one your team is facing now.

 
Following Quality, I joined Operations with the OWE team in order to boost my professional development with a wider exposure. A strong customer centricity, professional resilience, sharp attention to detail, and stakeholder management in a very complex environment are part of the daily business, especially in the area of Performance Management. This role soon provided me with very valuable assets, experience and a steep learning curve in terms of professional growth difficult to experience otherwise. The opportunity to interact with Senior leaders, create an extensive network, get to know different ways of working between different organisations, and develop a strategic mindset to influence others in order to get the outcomes required by the customer, are some of the most remarkable benefits this experience has provided me with.

I feel now is time to take the next step forward in my career in a new role that allows me to merge the expertise acquired previously while providing me with great development opportunities from a professional and personal perspective. Conscious as well of our synergies and your inspiring leadership, I truly believe that with my experience and work-ethic I can make a unique contribution to the new QWO organisation as a \textit{Business Integration Manager}, and strive for excellence with the same energy and passion as when I started my first day at Airbus.


 
 
%PARAGRAPH THREE: Request a personal interview and indicate your flexibility as to the time and place. Repeat your phone number in the letter and offer assistance to help in a speedy response. For example, state that you will be in the city where the company is located on a certain date and would like to set up an interview. Alternatively, state that you will call on a certain date to set up an interview. End the letter by thanking the employer for taking time to consider your credentials. 

I look forward to supporting you and the rest of the Quality team on the new and exciting challenges ahead with the new organisation. I remain at your disposal for any additional clarification you may require. Thank you for taking the time to read my letter and consider my application.
