I joined our Airbus family in 2020 to work in Quality at the Broughton Plant, one of the most important organizations within Airbus. The opportunity to work for a department in a Plant with such a solid heritage was enriching from the very beginning, mainly due to two reasons; a remarkable attention to detail, and a consolidated status-quo that continuously challenged any change and transformation initiatives within the organization. Therefore, working in Quality Performance Management while leading a brand-new digital transformation in the Q organisation helped me to develop not only an exhaustive attention to detail, but also the ability to design strategies for business transformation, and most importantly, change management.

 
Following Quality, I joined Operations with the OWE team in order to boost my professional development with a wider scope and all that that entails. A strong customer centricity, professional resilience, sharp attention to detail, and stakeholder management in a very complex environment are part of the daily business, especially in the area of Performance Management. This role soon provided me with very valuable assets, experience and a steep learning curve in terms of professional growth difficult to experience otherwise. The opportunity to interact with Senior leaders, create an extensive network, get to know different ways of working between different organisations, and develop a strategic mindset to influence others in order to get the outcomes required by the customer, are some of the most remarkable benefits this experience has entailed to myself.

Now, I feel it is time to make the next step forward in my career in a new role that allows me to merge the experience acquired previously while providing me with great development opportunities from a professional and personal perspective. Conscious of our sinergies and your inspiring leadership, I truly believe that with my experience and work-ethic I can make a unique contribution to the new QWO organisation as a \textit{Business Integrator Manager}, and strive for excellence with the same energy and passion as when I started my first day in Airbus.



%Throughout the last four years, I have been working at different Airbus divisions developing and leading innovative projects that have improved the aeronautical manufacturing processes and the business management. Some of the key successes are the achievement of the AOS Industrial Excellence in 2017 and 2018 in Puerto Real Plant or the Digital Quality BSC tool implemented in Broughton Plant. In order to accomplish them, my teams challenged the statu quo at all levels through digital transformation and stakeholder management (among other aspects). This has allowed me to acquire a solid experience in Data Analytics and Business Intelligence and a relevant experience in the field of operations as a Software Developer, Data Scientist and coach.
%
%Although this experience and studies are constantly providing me with an excellent professional background in the aerospace industry, I am continuously seeking to take a step forward in my career. For this reason, while working for Airbus, I have completed a Masters in Professional Development, a Masters in Big Data and Business Analytics and subsequently enrolled in a Masters in Astronautics and Space Engineering. These studies are allowing me not only to boost my skills in Data Science and Data Analysis but above all to take pleasure in understanding and using the power that data is offering nowadays.
%
%I truly believe that OWE is the perfect scenario to continue, improve and take that step forward in my professional career as I have already had the opportunity to participate in some of the activities in which teamwork, challenge, innovation, improvement, leadership, and \textit{Business Intelligence} were some of the key aspects. To me, stepping outside the comfort zone with challenging projects allowing new technical solutions is not only appropriate but the best way to achieve excellence and welcome the future in the so-called \textit{Era of Data}.
 
 
%PARAGRAPH THREE: Request a personal interview and indicate your flexibility as to the time and place. Repeat your phone number in the letter and offer assistance to help in a speedy response. For example, state that you will be in the city where the company is located on a certain date and would like to set up an interview. Alternatively, state that you will call on a certain date to set up an interview. End the letter by thanking the employer for taking time to consider your credentials. 

I look forward to supporting you and the rest of the Quality team on the new and exciting challenges ahead with the new QWO organisation. I remain at your disposal for any additional clarification you may require. Thank you for taking the time to read my letter and considering my application.

%I would be profoundly pleased and thankful to have the opportunity of joining your team to contribute Airbus to, as you mention, ``\textit{become the benchmark for the aerospace industry} [...] \textit{through continuous improvement driven by competitiveness, creativity and teamwork...}''. I encourage you to contact Gary Charnock if needed and I remain at your disposal for any additional clarification you may require. Thank you for taking the time to read my letter and considering my application.
